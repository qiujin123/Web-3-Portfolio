            Bembo typeface was create in 1495 by Francisco Griffo, an Italian punch-cutter. It was created during the
            Italian Renaissance period, where I mostly got my influences on for creating my Bembo poster. I took element
            from architectures, like the cathedral, to renaissance paintings to create my overall composition of my
            poster. Bembo typeface was unique to me because the serif of the typeface look ancient and cool to created
            unique cathedral style design.
