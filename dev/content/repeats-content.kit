            Photo Project - Life Repeats
        </h2>
        <p>
            Waking up each day only to repeat what you did yesterday. Life is like a simple command of Control C (copy)
            and Control V (paste). You wonder what life is about, where tomorrow is no difference than today. You repeat
            the task you do everyday and feels quite accomplished of completing that day task, only to find out you need
            to do thoses task again the next day. Trapped inside a room with nowhere to escape, you feel the stress that
            the next day would be the same as today. Little did you know that even though your life feels like a
            repetition, the world outside you is constantly changing. You can keep this up, but only death waits at the
            end of the repetition. Or you can break a habit and maybe life would be different the next day.
